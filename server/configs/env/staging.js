/*******************************************************************************
 * * Staging environment settings
 *
 * What you see below is a quick outline of the built-in settings you need to
 * configure your app for staging.  The configuration in this file is only
 * used in your staging environment, i.e. when you start your app using:
 *
 * ```
 * NODE_ENV=staging node app
 * ```
 *
 * > If you're using git as a version control solution for your app,
 * > this file WILL BE COMMITTED to your repository by default, unless you add
 * > it to your .gitignore file.  If your repository will be publicly viewable,
 * > don't add private/sensitive data (like API secrets / db passwords) to this 
 * > file!
